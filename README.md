# Node Modules Cleanup

`nm-cleanup` is a customizable Node.js CLI tool designed to remove unnecessary directories from outdated projects. 

## Why?

Over time, projects accumulate unnecessary files and folders, especially large directories like `node_modules` that can take up significant disk space. When projects are no longer actively maintained or used, these directories become redundant, but you don't want to waste time on manually identifying and removing them.

`nm-cleanup` automates this process, saving you time and effort. It scans your directories, identifies unused or outdated project folders, and cleans up unnecessary files (like `node_modules`), freeing up valuable disk space.

The tool provides various options allowing to define what to clean up, which makes it suitable for a wide range of cleanup tasks beyond just `node_modules`.

ðŸ’¡ It's built with **flexibility** and **automation** in mind, so it's a great fit for both running manually and scheduled background execution, for example with cron.

## How It Works
- Scan for projects: The tool recursively scans the specified root directory for project folders, as defined by the presence of project indicator files (e.g., `package.json`).
- Check modification times: For each project, the tool checks when the project was last modified (based on its contents and skipping directories matching `--exclude` pattern).
- Lock on target directories: The tool identifies target directories (e.g., `node_modules`) only in those projects that haven't been modified for a certain threshold of time (e.g., 30 days).
- Prompt for confirmation: Unless the `--yes` flag is used, the tool prompts for confirmation before deleting the identified directories.
- Delete target directories: Upon confirmation (or if the `--yes` flag is used), the tool deletes the identified target directories.

## Installation

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Then, install the tool globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g nm-cleanup
```

## Usage

```bash
nm-cleanup [rootDir] [options]
```

`[rootDir]`: The root directory containing all your projects. Defaults to the current directory (`.`).

**Example**
```bash
nm-cleanup
# or
nm-cleanup ~/projects
```

## Options

`nm-cleanup` provides a range of configurable options to allow flexible project cleanup. Below are detailed descriptions of each option and their usage.

### `-n, --name <regex>`

**Default**
```bash
node_modules
```

Specifies a regex pattern to match directory names that should be removed.

Use this option when you want to clean up other types of folders besides `node_modules`.

**Example**
```bash
nm-cleanup --name 'dist|node_modules|\.cache'
```

### `-t, --time <days>`

**Default**
```bash
30
```

Sets the threshold for how old a project should be (based on last modification time) before its directories are targeted for cleanup.

Use this option when you want to clean up projects that havenâ€™t been modified for a specific period.

**Example**
```bash
nm-cleanup --time 60
```

### `-x, --exclude <regex>`

**Default**
```bash
^\.
```

Excludes directories from the filesystem scan, preventing `nm-cleanup` from even entering those directories. By default all hidden directories are excluded.

Use this option to improve performance when you have large or unnecessary directories that donâ€™t need to be scanned, like backups, archives, or directories you know won't contain target folders.

**Example**
```bash
nm-cleanup --exclude '^logs|backups'
```

### `-p, --project [filenames...]`

**Default**
```bash
package.json
```

Defines the indicator files that mark a directory as a project. This allows `nm-cleanup` to treat any directory with these files as a project root.

Use this when working with projects that use different indicator files, such as `Cargo.toml` for Rust projects or `composer.json` for PHP projects.

**Example**
```bash
nm-cleanup --project composer.json gitlab-ci.yaml
```

### `-i, --ignore [paths...]`

**No default**

A list of paths to ignore during the cleanup process. This can include specific projects or nested directories.

Use this when you want to ensure that certain paths are never cleaned up.

**Example**
```bash
nm-cleanup --ignore projects/my-precious projects/special-project
```

### `-s, --separate-nested`

**Default**
```bash
false
```

When this option is enabled, `nm-cleanup` treats nested projects as independent entities for the purpose of modification time measurement. This means that the modification time of nested projects is considered separately from their parent projects. If a parent project is deemed outdated based on the modification time, its target folders will be cleaned up, while the nested projects, if still fresh, will be preserved. 

Without this flag, the entire recursive structure of a project is managed as a single unit, meaning that all nested projects are taken into account when assessing whether the project as a whole should be cleaned up.

Use this option when you have a monorepo or a project structure with nested projects that you want to manage independently. This *allows the cleanup of parent and sibling projects if only some of the nested siblings is not outdated*.

**Example**
```bash
nm-cleanup --separate-nested
```

### `-y, --yes`

**Default**
```bash
false
```

Skips the confirmation prompt and automatically proceeds with the cleanup.

Use this option when you want to run nm-cleanup in non-interactive environments, or life is to short to waste it on confirmation prompts.

**Example**
```bash
nm-cleanup --yes
```

### `--dry-run`

**Default**
```bash
false
```

Performs a dry run of the cleanup process, showing what would be deleted without actually making any changes.

Use this to safely check what the tool does or test custom options configurations.

```bash
nm-cleanup --dry-run
```

### `-h, --help`

Displays help information about the available commands and options.

**Example**
```bash
nm-cleanup --help
```
